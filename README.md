# GiftBook
Software Development Fall Term Final Project
*Yasmeen Roumie and Cindy Li*

## Description
Don't know what to get your friend for their birthday? Got someone you don't know for Secret Santa? Use GiftBook!

## Proposal
GiftBook will allow users to log into their Facebook and look for potential gifts to get people. It will try to analyze your top friends and also allow you to search for specific people. Based on their likes, it will spit out the top 3 gifts it thinks the person will want.

## Tools To Use
* Facebook SDK for JS
  ** Use Facebook to log in and look through friends
* Amazon API
  ** Display item along with details (price, description, etc)

## What We Don't Know How To Do
* Looking through things "liked" by certain people on Facebook
