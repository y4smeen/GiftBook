# RideEasy
Software Development Fall Term Final Project 
<br>
*Yasmeen Roumie and Cindy Li*

## Description
Always stuck on a crowded train? Tired of not getting a seat? Use RideEasy to plan out the least agonizing subway trip possible!

## Proposal
RideEasy will allow users to enter their desired trip time and destination. Based on MTA data, the tool will propose to the user the most comfortable trip possible. It will return multiple aspects of the trip that contribute to the ease of it: crowdedness, likeliness to get a seat, duration of travel.

## Tools To Use
* MTA API
  * real time data
  * subway schedules & stations
  * daily mta bridge traffic
* Google Maps API
  * tell you when you should leave the house to make the best train 
* Javascript
  * possible visual of how busy each train is throughout the day 

## To Do
- [ x ] Figure out how to use the API
- [ ] Make the UI/UX
