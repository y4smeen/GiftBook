## Description
Always stuck on a crowded train? Tired of not getting a seat? Use RideEasy to plan out the least agonizing subway trip possible!

## Proposal
RideEasy will allow users to enter their starting and ending locations. Based on MTA data, the tool will propose to the user trains that connect the two places and times that the trains will be running. If there is no connecting train, it will prompt the user to enter different locations.

## Tools To Use
* MTA API
  * real time data
  * subway schedules & stations
  * daily mta bridge traffic
* Google Maps API
  * tell you when you should leave the house to make the best train
